# Legends-Of-Idleon-Coin-Clicker
Automatically clicks the bronze coins for you. Leave the program to afk and gain coins.

How to use:
1. Download and extract the file.
2. Open the installer.bat.
3. Open the runner.bat.
4. Open the game.

Additional information:
With the download comes an image with the coin that is being collected.
You only have to run the installer.bat file once.
Press q or ctrl + alt + delete to cancel the program and stop collecting coins.
A warning should pop up during the install since I am an unknown developer, feel free to inspect the code yourself. It is not a virus.
